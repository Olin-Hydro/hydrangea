TIP:
A `.env` file is a plain text file used to store configuration settings and environment variables
for a software application, facilitating separation of sensitive data from the source code, and allowing
dynamic configuration at runtime.

To create a `.env` file:

On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS):

1. Open a terminal.
2. Use the following command to create the `.env` file:
   > > touch .env

On Windows:

1. Open a text editor like Notepad.
2. Create a new text document.
3. Save the document with the name `.env` (including the leading dot) in the directory where your project is located.

The `.env` file is a crucial part of many projects, as it enables you to manage configuration settings and sensitive data separately
from your codebase. It also facilitates the use of virtual environments and simplifies the installation of dependencies, keeping your
development environment clean and organized.
